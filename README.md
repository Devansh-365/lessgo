# LessGo

A challenge to release a small projects while learning golang. All projects are written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Preface

I found a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kkdai/project52) on this challenge and felt inspired to do the same in order to grow my Go skills. My aim is to build different types of projects in order to improve the range of my skills.

## Constraints

Here are the constraints of Project52:

- The project could be big or small, but it must be something new. Choose something you can finish within a week.
- You can use any programming language you like or even a mix of languages.
- You don't need to come up with a brand new idea. You could recreate an existing idea or project.

## Progress

1. [GoWeb: A Simple Web Server](https://github.com/Devansh-365/lessgo/tree/main/simple%20web%20server) - Simple web server build with goalng
2. [GoCrud: Crud API](https://github.com/Devansh-365/lessgo/tree/main/crud-api) - A crud api build while learning.

## Suggest an idea or encourage me

Please open an issue if you want to suggest a project idea (something that can be done within a week).

You can also encourage me by starring this project or any of my linked projects above.
